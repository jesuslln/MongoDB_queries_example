# MongoDB_queries_example
Here is a small project where I worked with two different dataset in MongoDB.  I created different queries to display and compute results and insights from the datasets. The two datasets I worked with are:

- Restaurants in New York.
- BCN (All public information about state's bicycles in Barcelona).
